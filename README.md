<!-- The first block of a blockchain is called genuses block and it does not have a prev hash
SHA256 it is secure hasing algorithm (64 characters) hexadecimal 1 character takes 4 bytes
So total 256 bytes of memory in the computer
Immutable ledger (Record book)
Distributed P2P network where the whole set of data is stored in all the computers in that network
So that if there is change in any one all the systems would help in restoring the data very quickly
Mining is all about predicting the nounce which would generate a hash that would be below the target
And would help in creating a block
Byzantine fault tolerence (castle and the commander story)(Less than 33.3% can be traitors)
Consensius protocol
1) To check if the block added by the miner is not malicius by checking proof of work
2) To decide which block would be added first in simultaneous addtion of blocks.
The block which would be spread in more than half of the network would be added first


Ethereum is a network made on which we can run our smart contracts 
Each computer in the network will have the copy of that smart contract 
In this each node will contain
1)History of the transactions/History of the smart contract/Current state of the smart contract
This blockchain is just like a virtual memory in everyones device soo that sending malicious code wont affect
files of others and also there is a gas fees over several operations performed in the ethereum

DAO(Decentralized autonomous organisations which can run on itself without involving ppl)

Soft fork the whole contract will update wheraes in the hard fork there would be two parellel networks created
Which means that one has to update in order to be a part of any

Ethereum network can be used to store money or data, networks are formed by one or more nodes
Each node is a machine running on ethereum client, each node can contain full copy of the blockchain
Blockchain is a database which keeps record of the all the trasactions which may ever have taken place

In ethereum one account is used on all the networks
It takes time to mine the blocks ...if it takes more time than it will raise the target value 
And accordingly when it finds a nounce which creates a hash less than the target it will make a block
The time taken from 0 to the target nonce is known as block time -->

# Small-node
My first blockchain project which is made on rinkeby network
